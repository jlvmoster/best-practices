# Best Practices for Behavior Driven Design

Definition of BDD from SAFe https://scaledagileframework.com/behavior-driven-development/, and from SmartBear https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/.

The three practices: `Discovery`, `Formulation`, and `Automation`

## Acceptance Criteria

Template: `As a`, `I want`, and `So that`

## Gherkin Syntax

The syntax is `GIVEN`, `WHEN`, `THEN` (Optionally `AND`, `BUT`) which is utilized in an Agile context. Follows the [Built-In Quality](https://scaledagileframework.com/built-in-quality/) SAFe practice. Typically found in a story's Acceptance Criteria.

`GIVEN` is the setup

`WHEN` is the action

`THEN` is the assertion
