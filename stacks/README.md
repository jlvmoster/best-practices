# My Favorite Tech Stacks

This README contains a list of my personal favorite tech stacks since I started my career in 2018 as a Software Engineer. I hope you find this document helpful in determining your choice of stack for your past, current and future projects.

## Web Application Stacks

### MEAN

MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node

> Note: the older, less popular version of this stack is called the `LAMP` stack (e.g. Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)

### MERN

MongoDB, Express, React, Node

### Jamstack

JavaScript, API, Markup

> Note: My personal favorite with jamstack is Next.js + a headless CMS hosted by Vercel, Netlify or your preferred hosting platform
