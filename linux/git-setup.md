# Setting up git on a linux box

## Install Git
```
sudo apt update & sudo apt install -y git
```

## Setup `git-prompt.sh` and `git-completion.bash`

### Install and configure git prompt
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh -o .git-prompt.sh
```

1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-prompt.sh).
2) Add the following line to your .bashrc/.zshrc:
   source ~/.git-prompt.sh
3a) Change your PS1 to call __git_ps1 as
    command-substitution:
    Bash: PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
    ZSH:  setopt PROMPT_SUBST ; PS1='[%n@%m %c$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
    the optional argument will be used as format string.
3b) Alternatively, for a slightly faster prompt, __git_ps1 can
    be used for PROMPT_COMMAND in Bash or for precmd() in Zsh
    with two parameters, <pre> and <post>, which are strings
    you would put in $PS1 before and after the status string
    generated by the git-prompt machinery.  e.g.
    Bash: PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "\u@\h:\w" "\\\$ "'
      will show username, at-sign, host, colon, cwd, then
      various status string, followed by dollar and SP, as
      your prompt.
    ZSH:  precmd () { __git_ps1 "%n" ":%~$ " "|%s" }
      will show username, pipe, then various status string,
      followed by colon, cwd, dollar and SP, as your prompt.
    Optionally, you can supply a third argument with a printf
    format string to finetune the output of the branch status


### Install and configure git completion
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o .git-completion.bash
```

1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-completion.bash).
2) Add the following line to your .bashrc/.zshrc:
   source ~/.git-completion.bash
3) Consider changing your PS1 to also show the current branch,
   see git-prompt.sh for details.
