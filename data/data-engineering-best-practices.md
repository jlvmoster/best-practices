# Best Practices on Data Engineering Concepts

## The Five Vs of Big Data

- Volume: how much data? (initial/growing size)
- Velocity: how fast is data generated and how quickly should it move? (batch vs stream)
- Variety: how diverse is the data? (unstructured, semi-structured, structured)
- Veracity: how accurate is the data? (quality)
- Value: what story is the data telling? (insights)

## Data Governance (DG)

> Data governance is everything you do to ensure data is secure, private, accurate, available, and usable. It includes the actions people must take, the processes they must follow, and the technology that supports them throughout the data life cycle.

### Data Stewardship

> A subset of DG which focuses on the core values such as data management and oversight in order to help provide business users with high-quality data that is easily accessible in a consistent manner.

## Data Lineage

> Data lineage is the process of tracking the flow of data over time, providing a clear understanding of where the data originated, how it was changed, and its ultimate destination within the data pipeline.
